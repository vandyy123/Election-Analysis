## This is a Github repository for all things Election Analysis

### Election Results
- This has a function that provides a comparison of two specified time periods within a dataset, and allows the user to compare the percent change of a demographic (e.g., race, party) between the time periods.
- This function also allows the user to specify how high a "threshold" they would like, so they only see results meeting that threshold.
